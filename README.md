# TopDownShooter
Unreal Engine C++ project where every character is created from a Pawn.

## Aim of the project
Unreal Engine has built in Character class that handles movements, animations, navmesh.
Instead of using Character class, I am trying to do this with Pawn class. So I will add all the functionality
by myself. Of course I will use Unreal Engine's classes like PathFindingComponent. 
The reason I do this is understanding the basic's of the workflow and create scalable project.
